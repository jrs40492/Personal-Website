    | The idea for this website started back in 2011. Line ups were being tracked through messages and
    | stats/standings were being calculated by hand. Quickly realizing there must be a better way, this website was born. Over
    | the past 8 years, it's gone through 6 different redesigns along with hundreds (maybe thousands) of improvements
    | and changes.
