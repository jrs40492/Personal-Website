Even though most developers will probably build their own site to showcase their talents, I decided to add mine to github for anyone to use. Hopefully this website will provide a good starting point for new developers or perhaps backend developers looking to expand.

### Setup & Installation
1. Run "npm install"
2. Create .env file in top directory
3. Copy contents of .env.example to .env file
4. Populate with desired values
5. Run "Grunt dev"
6. Navigate to <a href="http://localhost:3000">localhost:3000</a>


### TODO
* Add full user accessibility
* Ability to dynamically add projects
* Add backend to easily change wording and resume

### Ideas
* Add a blog
