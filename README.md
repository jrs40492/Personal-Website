Even though most developers will probably build their own site to showcase their talents, I decided to add mine to github for anyone to use. Hopefully this website will provide a good starting point for new developers or perhaps backend developers looking to expand.

### Setup & Installation
1. Create .env file in top directory
2. Copy contents of .env.example to .env file
3. Populate with desired values
4. Run "Grunt dev"
5. Navigate to <a href="http://localhost:3000">localhost:3000</a>


### TODO
* Add full user accessibility
* Ability to dynamically add projects
* Add backend to easily change wording and resume

### Ideas
* Add a blog
