Even though most developers will probably build their own site to showcase their talents, I decided to add mine to github for anyone to use. Hopefully this website will provide a good starting point for new developers or perhaps backend developers looking to expand.

### Installation
1. Run "Grunt dev"
2. Navigate to localhost:3000


### TODO
* Add full user accessibility
* Remove carousel/add better way to view projects
* Ability to dynamically add projects

### Ideas
* Add a blog
